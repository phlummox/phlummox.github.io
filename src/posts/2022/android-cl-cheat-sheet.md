A reminder to myself. I do work on Android apps rarely enough that
I can never remember what the tools and commands are for different
tasks -- so I started putting together a "cheat sheet" for my own use
for [Android devâ€“related command-line tools][cheatsheet].

Reddit post [here][reddit], where someone pointed out [this][adb-sheet]
massively useful reference for `adb` commands.
